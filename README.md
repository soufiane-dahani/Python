# Python Piscine

## What is a Piscine?

A piscine is split into many small projects (modules), with each day introducing a new concept related to Python. Validating this piscine requires significant investment.

## Important Rules

- Cannot validate working only on one or two projects
- Submit your work every day (even incomplete work)
- At least a week's worth of work required
- Each initialized repository closes after one day
- Two days to complete required peer evaluations per module
- Possible to retry modules without waiting
- **Work with other students - don't do this alone**

## About Python

Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language widely used in data science due to its extensive collection of libraries.

## Required Projects (in order)

1. **Python - 0 - Starting**
2. **Python - 1 - Array**
3. **Python - 2 - DataTable**
4. **Python - 3 - OOP**
5. **Python - 4 - Dod**

Each project must be completed in order. You cannot register for a project until the previous one is validated.
